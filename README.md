Welcome to the GitHub repository for the interview task provided in [this Notion link](https://korvinparis.notion.site/Test-2-02a4e3d656614e21ad4d98154d453632). To get started, follow these instructions:


Clone this repository using the following command:

npm install
npm install --save-dev sequelize-cli
npm install sequelize pg pg-hstore
